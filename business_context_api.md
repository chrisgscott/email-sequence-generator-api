   - Potential for multiple revenue streams (API access, custom AI models, consulting)
   - Valuable data insights that can inform product development and market trends

### Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
"Empower your AI with deep business understanding. BusinessContextAPI provides a single source of truth for your business context, enabling AI that truly gets your company - from your unique value proposition to your brand voice. Transform generic AI into your personal business intelligence engine."

Key differentiators include:
1. **Holistic Business Understanding**: Unlike narrow, function-specific AI tools, our API provides a comprehensive view of the business.
2. **Evolving Intelligence**: The system learns and adapts as the business grows and changes.
3. **Interoperability**: One API to enhance multiple AI applications, both existing and future.
4. **Privacy-Focused**: Business data stays within the company's control, addressing key AI adoption concerns.

### Strategic Alignment
This project aligns with several key technology trends:
1. The shift towards more personalized and context-aware AI
2. Increasing demand for AI solutions in business that go beyond generic models
3. Growing concerns about data privacy and control in AI applications
4. The need for efficient, scalable AI solutions for businesses of all sizes

By positioning ourselves at the intersection of these trends, we're not just creating a product, but potentially shaping the future of how businesses interact with AI technologies.

### Immediate and Future Impact
In the short term, the BusinessContextAPI will enhance our email generation tool, providing immediate value to our existing customers. However, its true potential lies in its future applications:

1. **Expansion of AI Services**: As we develop the API, we can create a suite of AI-powered tools (chatbots, content generators, decision support systems) that all leverage the same business context.

2. **AI Consultation Services**: The process of helping businesses articulate their context can evolve into a valuable consultation service.

3. **Ecosystem Development**: By opening the API to third-party developers, we can foster an ecosystem of business-specific AI applications.

4. **Advanced Analytics**: As we aggregate (anonymized) data across businesses, we can provide valuable industry insights and benchmarks.

5. **Custom AI Models**: The ultimate goal is to use this data to train custom AI models for each business, providing truly personalized AI assistants.

By starting with a focused, achievable goal (enhancing our email tool) but designing with this broader vision in mind, we're laying the groundwork for a potentially transformative business AI platform.

### Key Components

1. **app/main.py**: Entry point for the FastAPI application
2. **app/api/context.py**: API route handlers for context operations
3. **app/models/context.py**: SQLAlchemy model for business context
4. **app/schemas/context.py**: Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
5. **app/services/context_service.py**: Business logic for context operations
6. **app/db/database.py**: Database connection and session management
7. **app/core/config.py**: Configuration settings
8. **app/core/security.py**: Authentication and security utilities

### Database Interaction

Use SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations. Example model:
from sqlalchemy import Column, String, JSON, DateTime
from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import UUID
from sqlalchemy.sql import func
from app.db.database import Base
class BusinessContext(Base):
tablename = "business_contexts"
id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, index=True)
data = Column(JSON, nullable=False)
created_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now())
updated_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), onupdate=func.now())


### API Implementation

Example of creating a business context:
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from app.schemas.context import BusinessContextCreate, BusinessContextResponse
from app.services import context_service
from app.core.security import get_current_user
from app.db.database import get_db
router = APIRouter()
@router.post("/context", response_model=BusinessContextResponse)
async def create_business_context(
context: BusinessContextCreate,
db: Session = Depends(get_db),
current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
return context_service.create_context(db, context)


### Authentication

Implement JWT authentication for the web interface:
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
from jose import JWTError, jwt
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from app.core.config import settings
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")
def create_access_token(data: dict):
to_encode = data.copy()
expire = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=settings.ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES)
to_encode.update({"exp": expire})
encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, settings.SECRET_KEY, algorithm=settings.ALGORITHM)
return encoded_jwt
async def get_current_user(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
credentials_exception = HTTPException(
status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
detail="Could not validate credentials",
headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Bearer"},
)
try:
payload = jwt.decode(token, settings.SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[settings.ALGORITHM])
username: str = payload.get("sub")
if username is None:
raise credentials_exception
except JWTError:
raise credentials_exception
user = get_user(username)
if user is None:
raise credentials_exception
return user


### API Key Authentication

For service-to-service communication, implement API key authentication:
from fastapi import Security, HTTPException
from fastapi.security.api_key import APIKeyHeader
from app.core.config import settings
api_key_header = APIKeyHeader(name="X-API-Key", auto_error=False)
async def get_api_key(api_key_header: str = Security(api_key_header)):
if api_key_header == settings.API_KEY:
return api_key_header
else:
raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Could not validate API key")



### Logging

Implement comprehensive logging:
import logging
from app.core.config import settings
logging.basicConfig(level=settings.LOG_LEVEL)
logger = logging.getLogger(name)
In your API handlers
@router.post("/context")
async def create_business_context(...):
logger.info(f"Creating business context for {context.company_name}")
# ... rest of the function
logger.info(f"Business context created successfully for {context.company_name}")



### Error Handling

Implement custom exception handlers:
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
class BusinessContextException(Exception):
def init(self, name: str):
self.name = name
@app.exception_handler(BusinessContextException)
async def business_context_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: BusinessContextException):
return JSONResponse(
status_code=400,
content={"message": f"Error with business context: {exc.name}"},
)


### Data Validation

Use Pydantic for request and response validation:
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Optional
from uuid import UUID
class ProductService(BaseModel):
name: str
description: str
class BusinessContextCreate(BaseModel):
company_name: str
industry: str
brief_description: str
key_products_services: List[ProductService]
target_audience: str
unique_selling_points: List[str]
tone_of_voice: str
do_not_mention: Optional[List[str]] = Field(default_factory=list)
class BusinessContextResponse(BusinessContextCreate):
business_id: UUID
created_at: datetime
updated_at: datetime


### Testing

Example of a test case using pytest:
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app.main import app
client = TestClient(app)
def test_create_business_context():
response = client.post(
"/api/v1/context",
json={
"company_name": "Test Company",
"industry": "Technology",
"brief_description": "We create amazing software",
"key_products_services": [
{"name": "Product A", "description": "Our flagship product"}
],
"target_audience": "Small businesses",
"unique_selling_points": ["Innovative", "User-friendly"],
"tone_of_voice": "Professional yet approachable"
}
)
assert response.status_code == 200
assert "business_id" in response.json()
