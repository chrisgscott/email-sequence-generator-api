# Email Sequence Generator API Project Roadmap

Last updated: 2024-09-07

## High Priority Tasks

### Basic Content Moderation
- [ ] Implement basic filtering or review system for generated content

### Email Sequence Generation Improvements
- [ ] Implement content diversity checks to avoid repetitive emails
- [ ] Add support for dynamic content insertion based on user behavior or external data
- [ ] Implement a mechanism to ensure consistent tone and style across all emails in a sequence

### API Enhancements
- [ ] Add endpoints for checking sequence generation progress
- [ ] Implement endpoint for manually triggering email sends
- [ ] Create endpoint for updating or canceling scheduled emails
- [ ] Add an endpoint for retrieving generated email content for preview

### System Resilience and Error Handling
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern for inter-service communication
- [ ] Implement a queue system for webhook requests
- [ ] Implement a retry mechanism for failed email generations within a batch

## Medium Priority (Important for Robustness and User Experience)

### Testing
- [ ] Develop unit tests for core functionalities
- [ ] Create integration tests for the email generation and sending process
- [ ] Implement a system for testing generators before deployment
- [ ] Allow for sample runs with test data

### Monitoring and Alerts
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerts for failed or long-running sequences
- [ ] Set up monitoring for critical system components
- [ ] Implement alerting for errors or system issues
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for system health
- [ ] Display usage statistics, error rates, and other relevant metrics for generators
- [ ] Add monitoring for OpenAI API usage and costs

### Database Optimization
- [ ] Review and optimize database queries
- [ ] Add indexes for frequently accessed fields

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Review and enhance authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

### Email Deliverability
- [ ] Set up monitoring for email engagement metrics
- [ ] Regularly review and optimize based on Brevo's deliverability reports

### Version Control for Generated Content
- [ ] Implement system for handling updates to already generated sequences

### API Versioning
- [ ] Plan and implement API versioning
- [ ] Create a system for versioning individual generators

### Duplicate Content Detection
- [ ] Implement system to scan OpenAI responses for duplicate or very similar content within a single subscriber's email sequence
- [ ] Develop strategy for handling detected duplicates (e.g., regeneration, minor modifications)

### Admin Dashboard - Basic
- [ ] Create basic admin area for viewing subscribers' sequences
- [ ] Implement basic tracking for open and click rates

### Handling Different Email Clients
- [ ] Test email templates across various email clients and devices
- [ ] Implement responsive design for email templates
- [ ] Create a process for regular testing and updating of email templates

## Lower Priority (For Future Enhancements)

### Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation to reflect new retry endpoint and email generation behavior
- [ ] Create user guide for email sequence generation process
- [ ] Document the process of creating and adding new generators
- [ ] Create a changelog system to track modifications to generators over time

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile application to identify and address bottlenecks
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., user inputs, email structures)

## To Consider (Future Ideas and Enhancements)

### Generator Setup Tool
- [ ] Develop a tool for creating form code, JSON, and scripts to quickly set up new generators
- [ ] Automate the generation of information needed for WordPress plugin admin screens

### Monetization Features
- [ ] Implement a system for injecting Calls to Action for monetized content into emails
- [ ] Create options for manual addition of "Sponsored" sections in Brevo templates
- [ ] Develop integration with payment systems for dynamic content injection based on advertiser packages

### SEO Content Generation
- [ ] Create a system for generating SEO-optimized content using user-generated content from each generator
- [ ] Implement AI-driven, programmatic SEO approach for targeting long-tail keywords
- [ ] Integrate with keyword data and NLP tools for content optimization

### Interactive Journal Prompts
- [ ] Develop a feature allowing subscribers to reply to emails with journal entries
- [ ] Create a system for anonymizing and publicly posting user-submitted journal entries
- [ ] Implement access controls (e.g., subscriber-only viewing of anonymized entries)

### Social Media Content Generation
- [ ] Create a system to extract the best-generated prompts for use in social media posts
- [ ] Develop functionality to display inputs alongside generated content in social media posts

### Custom Model Training for Businesses
- [ ] Implement a system for companies to train models using their own relevant content
- [ ] Develop integration with CRM data for personalized email sequence generation
- [ ] Create mechanisms to ensure generated content aligns with a company's business and offerings
